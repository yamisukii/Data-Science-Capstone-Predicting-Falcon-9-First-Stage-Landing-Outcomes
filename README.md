# Data-Science-Capstone-Predicting-Falcon-9-First-Stage-Landing-Outcomes
This capstone project aims to predict the landing success of the Falcon 9 first stage, which is crucial for determining the cost-efficiency of SpaceX rocket launches. By accurately predicting landings, we can help alternate companies competitively bid against SpaceX for space launches.
